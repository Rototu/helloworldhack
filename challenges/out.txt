Dear Musha,

I am still here at the U.S. Naval Hospital being watched over by some experts in the art of bringing one back to normal. I am feeling fine and dandy and wish I was with you and the boys being so close, but it won’t be long now, I hope. I needed a short rest for my nerves were kind of jittery. I have been looking to the bright side of life and everything is going to turn out all right. Where there is a will there is a way.

Is Dad still kicking those chubby legs around and smoking his five cent cigars? How is Sandford’s garden coming along I wish I could taste some of them victory garden vegetables of his. Let’s hear from you all.

Love - Frank.
